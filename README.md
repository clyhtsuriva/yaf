## Brief

Yet Another Fetch is a tool that fetches system information and shows it in a beautiful way for some extra upvotes on r/unixporn. It is extremely minimal and customizability is it's strong feature. Don't want to show your disk usage? Hide it with the `exclude` flag. Want to change the separator between the `os` and `Arch Linux` field? Use `separator` flag.

`yaf` is written in Golang. (Because everyone is writing a fetch in some language, why not Go then?)

## Installation

- [Binary](#binary)
- [Arch Linux](#arch-linux)
- [Gentoo Linux](#gentoo-linux)
- [Manual](#manual)

### Binary

Get the [latest release](https://github.com/deepjyoti30/yaf/releases) binary from GitHub and use it on your system. Yes, as simple as that.

### Arch Linux

`yaf` is available on [AUR here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yafetch) and can be installed with:

```console
yay -S yafetch
```

or

```console
paru -S yafetch
```

>NOTE: `yaf` was taken so had to publish with `yafetch` name.

### Gentoo Linux

You can install yaf, by adding the overlay to layman with this command
```console
sudo layman -a thamognya
```
and then you can do 

```console
sudo emerge -a yaf
```
It will ask you to unmask it, as it is still testing for bugs (this is standard procedure for new ebuilds) hence you can unmask it by doing
```console
sudo emerge yaf --autounmask && dispatch-conf
``` 
then type `u` 

and then emerge it with the following command

```console
sudo emerge -a yaf --autounmask
```

and then install the package how you would normally.


### Manual

If you wish, you can install the package manually using the following:

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:deepjyoti30/yaf.git`
- Cd into the repo and use make to install the package: `cd yaf && make install`

> NOTE: You might want to use the mighty `sudo` with the make command above.

## Usage

```console
Usage of yaf:
  -exclude disk os
    	Exclude the passed fields from output. Values should be space separated, eg: disk os (default "username hostname")
  -key-prefix string
    	Prefix to be set before the key is printed (default "â–ª ")
  -no-color
    	Disable showing colors in the output
  -separator string
    	Separator to be used between the key and the value (default "  ")
```
